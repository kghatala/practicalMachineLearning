# practicalMachineLearning

This repository contains my course project for the [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn) course, offered on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University. I used this course (along with [this book](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-r)) to become familiar with various machine learning pakcages that have already been written for R. I found both to be very useful for overviews of the different types of analyses that can be accomplished using existing R machine learning packages, and for ideas on how to build custom-designed analyses. For a closer look into the mechanics of some of the machine learning algorithms used in these packages, I would recommend the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course, offered on Coursera by Andrew Ng from Stanford University.

As mentioned above, this repository contains materials from my course project for the Practical Machine Learning course. My R markdown file is the "machineLearningProject.md" file, and the compiled HTML version is labelled "machineLearningProject.html". I have also created a gh-pages branch so the compiled HTML file can also be viewed as an HTML web page by following the link: kghatala.github.io/machineLearningProject.
